3. Shiny app for K-mean&PCA on RNA sequencing.<br />
Lab 2 has 3 parts.<br /> 
**Part 1 Simulation-Study explores the behavior of running K-means with or without extracting the top 3 PCs:** <br />
Explore the behavior of running K-means with or without extracting the top 3 PCs, using a simulated dataset.<br /> 
We would like to see whether clustering can accurately recover the original<br />
distribution of each of the points.<br />
The goal is to compare the accuracy and the speed of two algorithms, for<br />
different dimension $p$ and different levels of variation.<br />
I compare K-means with or without extracting the top 3 PCs, using a simulated dataset.<br />

**Part 2 :** <br />

In the Comparing demographic and election data<br />

I Used Cluster dendrogram and Baker gamma index
